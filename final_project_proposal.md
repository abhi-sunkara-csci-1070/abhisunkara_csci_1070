1. I will be working alone on this project. My plan on completing this to dedicate about 1 hour of research/work on this project per day while leaving the weekends as a way for me to unwind on that project stress. But on the week before my project is due, I will dedicate about 2 hours on each weekday and about 5 hours on the weekend.
2. I am using a breast cancer dataset. The link is here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/14/breast+cancer
3. Null: For the breast cancer dataset, there will be no difference between age status, menopausal status, tumor size, and the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence
   Alternative: For the breast cancer dataset, there will be a difference between age status, menopausal status, tumor size, and the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence
4. I plan to use logistic regression and a Decision Tree. Logistic regression because it shows coefficients that directly show the impact of each feature on the likelihood for recurrence of breast cancer. Logistic Regression is also computationally efficient considering my dataset is moderate size and has categorical variables. And a Decision tree because it will split the breast cancer data based on values such as age status or menopausal status.
