# 1. I will be working alone on this project. My plan on completing this to dedicate about 1 hour of research/work on this project per day 
# while leaving the weekends as a way for me to unwind on that project stress. But on the week before my project is due, I will 
# dedicate about 2 hours on each weekday and about 5 hours on the weekend.

# 2. I am using a breast cancer dataset. The link is here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/14/breast+cancer

# 3. 

# Null: For the breast cancer dataset, there will be no difference between recurring breast cancer and a young age.

# Alternative: For the breast cancer dataset, there will be a difference between recurring breast cancer and old age

# 4. I plan to apply linear regression and logistic regression.
